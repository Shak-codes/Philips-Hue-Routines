# Shak's Smart-Home
A mobile Smart Home and Automation application

## Features

### Lighting
Through the app, users can easily turn lights on or off, adjust brightness levels, and even change the color or color temperature of the lights if they support such features. Additionally, users can create custom lighting routines, specifying the time of day or specific events when the lights should automatically turn on or off, providing a convenient and personalized lighting experience. This level of control and automation not only enhances the ambiance of your room but also contributes to energy efficiency and convenience in your daily life.

### Temperature
Users can use the app to set their desired temperature and heating schedule, adjusting the climate to their comfort. Moreover, the app can monitor the room's temperature and trigger the heating system to turn on or off when it reaches specific thresholds, ensuring the room stays at the desired level of warmth.

### Air Quality
The app can provide real-time data on air quality parameters like humidity, particulate matter, and VOC levels. Users can receive alerts or set the app to automatically activate air purification devices when air quality falls below predefined thresholds.

### Routines
#### Time-Based Routines
Time-based routines allow users to schedule and automate actions at specific times of the day. For instance, users can set routines to turn the lights on every morning to wake them up gently and turn them off at a specific time in the evening for bedtime. These routines provide a consistent and convenient way to manage lighting throughout the day, improving comfort and energy efficiency.

#### Event-Based Routines
Event-based routines are more dynamic and responsive to specific conditions or triggers. In your example, you can create a routine to turn the lights on two days before an assignment is due to serve as a reminder. This type of routine can be programmed to respond to various events, such as weather changes, calendar events, or sensor data. It offers a personalized and adaptable approach to home automation, ensuring your smart app is not just reactive but also proactive in assisting with your daily life.
